# Jellyfin-media-server-docker

I use Jellyfin as my personal media server. The official image is easy to set up with docker-compose. I run my instance behind an nginx Proxy.
I also do use the official Mobile apps. (Jellyfin Android, availeble in the playstore. You can use this app to start a movie from ur phone and Finamp as a "Spotify clone" so I have my music availble to me whereever I go).
